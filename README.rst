HPE Alletra MP, HPE Alletra 9000, HPE Primera and HPE 3PAR REST Client
======================================================================
This is a Client library that can talk to the HPE Alletra MP, Alletra 9000, Primera
and 3PAR Storage array that has a REST web service interface and a
command line interface. This client library implements a simple interface for talking
with either interface, as needed. The python Requests library is used to communicate
with the REST interface. The python paramiko library is used to communicate with the
command line interface over an SSH connection.

This is the new location for the rebranded HP 3PAR Rest Client and will be
where all future releases are made. It was previously located on PyPi at:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/hp3parclient

The GitHub repository for the old HP 3PAR Rest Client is located at:
https://github.com/hpe-storage/python-3parclient/tree/3.x

The HP 3PAR Rest Client (hp3parclient) is now considered deprecated.

Documentation
=============

To build the documentation::

 $ tox -e docs

To view the built documentation point your browser to::

 docs/html/index.html


Running Simulators
==================

The unit tests should automatically start/stop the simulators.  To start them
manually use the following commands.  To stop them, use 'kill'.  Starting them
manually before running unit tests also allows you to watch the debug output.

* WSAPI::

  $ python test/HPE3ParMockServer_flask.py -port 5001 -user <USERNAME> -password <PASSWORD> -debug

* SSH::

  $ python test/HPE3ParMockServer_ssh.py [port]

Building wheel dist
===================

This client now supports building via the new python WHEELS standard.  Take
a look at http://pythonwheels.com

* building::

  $ python setup.py bdist_wheel

* building and uploading::

  $ python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel upload
